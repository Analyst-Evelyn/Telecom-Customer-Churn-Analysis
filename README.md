# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
## Project Description
This project focuses on analysing customer churn data from a telecommunications company in the USA to uncover trends, patterns, service satisfaction, and key drivers of churn. The objective is to identify key drivers of churn, understand customer profiles, and uncover actionable insights that can guide data-driven decision-making and customer retention strategies. Using Power BI for visualisation and DAX for custom calculations, the goal is to build an insightful, interactive dashboard that helps the company improve customer retention, identify high-risk segments, and make data-informed business decisions.
## Project Goals and Objectives
Analyse customer data to determine churn patterns across different customer segments.
Identify and visualise key drivers contributing to customer churn.
Segment customer profiles (e.g., churned, joined, retained) for targeted interventions.
Provide actionable business recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
Develop a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders.
## Problem Statement
Customer churn poses a significant challenge for most telecom companies, especially when high-value clients are lost without a clear understanding of why. Despite offering various services, many customers discontinue their subscriptions due to poor support, billing issues, or better competitor offers. This project seeks to uncover the patterns behind customer churn and help the company design more targeted and effective retention strategies, especially for high-value customers, leveraging data analytics.

# Key Findings  
### **Customer Overview**  
* The dataset includes 7,043 customers segmented into: Joined, Stayed, and Churned.<br>
* Average monthly charge across all customers: $64.77.<br>
* Approximately 25% of customers are classified as "High Value" based on revenue contribution.<br>
  

### **Customer Retention Trends**
* The majority of customers who churned had monthly charges above average.<br>
* High-value customers make up a significant portion of churned accounts.<br>
* Tenure among churned customers is relatively low, suggesting issues in early-stage customer experience.<br>  

### **Churn Drivers**
* Top churn reasons include: Competitor Offer, Dissatisfaction with Service, Poor Technical Support, and Billing Issues.<br>
* Month-to-month contracts are correlated with higher churn rates.<br>  

### **Customer Profiles**
* Churned Customers: High monthly charges, limited add-on services, mostly on month-to-month contracts.<br>
* Joined Customers: Newer, lower tenure, average revenue customers.<br>
*  Retained Customers: Tend to have longer tenure and multiple service subscriptions.<br>  

### **Recommendations**
1. Use churn reason data to design tailored win-back offers addressing specific dissatisfaction points.
2. Introduce incentives for longer-term contract adoption (e.g., 6-month/12-month pricing discounts).
3. Introduce check-in calls/emails in the first 3 months.<br>
4. Provide welcome discounts or tailored onboarding packages for new users to increase early satisfaction.<br>
5. Launch a loyalty program targeted at high-value customers.<br>
6. Offer exclusive support channels and rewards for long-term users.<br>
